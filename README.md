# Wikipedia Text Preprocessing and Visualization for NLP

## Overview

This project delves into Natural Language Processing (NLP) by applying text preprocessing and visualization techniques on Wikipedia data. Our objective is to showcase how NLP can be utilized to clean, process, and extract valuable insights from textual data, enhancing understanding and driving informed decisions.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning and Normalization:** Streamlining text data for uniformity and clarity.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Discovering patterns and trends through visual data exploration.
- **Text Preprocessing Techniques:** Implementing methods like stopwords removal, rare words filtering, and lemmatization to refine text data.
- **Visualization:** Employing bar plots and word clouds to illustrate the frequency and relevance of words in the dataset.
- **Insights Extraction:** Deriving meaningful conclusions from processed textual data that can influence strategies and decision-making.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Libraries:** pandas, matplotlib, WordCloud, textblob, NLTK
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
